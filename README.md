# Twitter-Data
This project covers the analysis of Twitter data on the Social Perception of Universities in Malaysia. The project aims to analyze the topics of interest for people in the social network community about issues related to university enrolment, management, teaching and learning, academic and non-academic staff, etc. Social Media and the internet are not new nowadays in delivering information and expressing feelings and emotions. For this, we thought that the available Social Media Data like Twitter data could be valuable to help universities understand the community's perceptions about their services.
